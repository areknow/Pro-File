## Installation
This application requires PHP and a web server. Install the file structure in your www folder and access it through a browser.

## Application instructions

Welcome to Pro-File. Please use the buttons to upload your System Profile in XLM format, and your Dashboards in a ZIP archive.

The System Profile can be accessed through the Dynatrace client by right clicking on your System Profile in the Cockpit, and choosing "Export System Profile...".

The Dashboards can be exported manually one at a time in the "Open Dashboards" dialog, or by accessing the Dynatrace Server file system directly at "DT_HOME/server/conf/dashboards". Compress the dashboard folder in ZIP format before uploading to this utility.
Once both are uploaded and validated by the utility, the Search button will become available.

For more information, please contact Arnaud Crowther at arnaud.crowther@dynatrace.com.
